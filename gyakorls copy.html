    <p>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="szinek.css"> PMC
        In PMC mode, you play as your main character hired by a private military company (either USEC or BEAR).
        You start at the beginning of a raid instance on your selected map, carrying items and gears you have equipped
        to your character at the stash.
        As a PMC operator, you may engage and kill other PMC operators or Scavs. In order to survive the raid and escape
        with any items you are carrying,
        you must locate and move into an extraction zone, of which the list is available in-game by double-tapping the
        “O” key.
    </p>




    <p>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="szinek.css"> Scav
        In Scav mode you play as a member of the Scav faction, a "Player Scav".
        Player Scavs have randomized gear and equipment, often low quality or unbalanced, and will spawn midway through
        a raid session.
        The time remaining when spawned in is a fixed range dependent on the map. However, nearly all of the time Scavs
        will spawn with less than half of the raid remaining.
        Unlike PMCs, Player Scavs have the advantage of AI Scavs not being aggressive unless one has done damage to
        another Scav, AI or Player.
        An exception is if another Player Scav attacks another Player Scav first, then the second one retaliates. If a
        Player Scav draws aggression by damaging another Scav, only AI Scavs within a fixed radius
        will be aggressive with the exception of Factory, where all Scavs will remain aggressive for the rest of the
        raid. Scavs are also given some additional unique extracts depending on the map. While Player Scav
        raids have some advantages, you cannot progress your PMC's stats or quests while playing as a Scav with an
        exception being finding and extracting with non-quest items.
        This means a Player's Scav character levels their skills independently from their PMC.
